### Overview

My second project, and first foray into **building a full-stack database backed application.** Built on Sinatra and coded with Ruby, including a relational database   hosted on Heroku.

### My Stock Tracker app

I'm a keen trader(when I have the time), and as such I use a variety of trader platforms to keep an eye on intra-day pricing. However these can be quite cumbersome when viewing on my smartphone !
I decided to build a lightweight, clean app to allow quick ASX stock code lookup, show me the current market price, and allow a simple login service for me to 'track' a selection of stocks at a glance. These features, and the design, are also intended to be easily used on my smartphone. 

### App deployed on Heroku:

### Initial design wireframes

I immediately had a clear idea of functionality, and was able to draw up some wireframes of features, buttons and such that would be needed.

While the app in its current form has deviated a little from the wireframes, I will revist and develop the design for mobile viewing.

### Technical Requirements

The minimum requirements for this project are:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using the application, and one that represents the main functional idea for the app
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of the resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
* **Utilize SQL or an ORM to create a database table structure** and interact with the relationally-stored data
* **Include wireframes** designed during the planning process
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public
